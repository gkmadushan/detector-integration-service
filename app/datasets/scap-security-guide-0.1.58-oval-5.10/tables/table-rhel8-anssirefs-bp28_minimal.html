<td>Set Password Maximum Age</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">To specify password maximum age for new accounts,
edit the file <code>/etc/login.defs</code>
and add or correct the following line:
<pre>PASS_MAX_DAYS <xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></pre>
A value of 180 days is sufficient for many environments.
The DoD requirement is 60.
The profile requirement is <code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords
need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime
of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the
operating system passwords could be compromised.
<br><br>
Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to
periodically change their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes
increases the risk of users writing down the password in a convenient
location subject to physical compromise.</td>

<td>Set Password Minimum Length in login.defs</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">To specify password length requirements for new accounts, edit the file
<code>/etc/login.defs</code> and add or correct the following line:
<pre>PASS_MIN_LEN <xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_password_minlen_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></pre>

The DoD requirement is <code>15</code>.
The FISMA requirement is <code>12</code>.

<code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_password_minlen_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.
If a program consults <code>/etc/login.defs</code> and also another PAM module
(such as <code>pam_pwquality</code>) during a password change operation, then
the most restrictive must be satisfied. See PAM section for more
information about enforcing password quality requirements.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Requiring a minimum password length makes password
cracking attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger
search space. However, any security benefit from an onerous requirement
must be carefully weighed against usability problems, support costs, or counterproductive
behavior that may result.</td>

<td>Ensure PAM Enforces Password Requirements - Minimum Digit Characters</td>

usage of digits in a password. When set to a negative number, any password will be required to
contain that many digits. When set to a positive number, pam_pwquality will grant +1 additional
length credit for each digit. Modify the <code>dcredit</code> setting in
<code>/etc/security/pwquality.conf</code> to require the use of a digit in passwords.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Use of a complex password helps to increase the time and resources required
to compromise the password. Password complexity, or strength, is a measure of
the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force
attacks.

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of
possible combinations that need to be tested before the password is compromised.
