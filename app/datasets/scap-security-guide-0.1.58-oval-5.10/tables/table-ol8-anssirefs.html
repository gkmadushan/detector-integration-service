<td>Uninstall DHCP Server Package</td>

the dhcp package can be uninstalled.

The <code>dhcp</code> package can be removed with the following command:
<pre>
$ sudo yum erase dhcp</pre>

not installed by default.
The <code>sendmail</code> package can be removed with the following command:
<pre>
$ sudo yum erase sendmail</pre>

<td xml:lang="en-US">The sendmail software was not developed with security in mind and
its design prevents it from being effectively contained by SELinux.  Postfix

xinetd service's accidental (or intentional) activation.</td>

<td>Remove NIS Client</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages,
is a client-server directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration
files. The NIS client (<code>ypbind</code>) was used to bind a system to an NIS server
and receive the distributed configuration files.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable
to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying
NIS maps. NIS generally has been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is recommended that the service be
removed.</td>

The <code>rsh</code> package contains the client commands

for the rsh services</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">These legacy clients contain numerous security exposures and have
been replaced with the more secure SSH package. Even if the server is removed,
it is best to ensure the clients are also removed to prevent users from
inadvertently attempting to use these commands and therefore exposing

their credentials. Note that removing the <code>rsh</code> package removes

the clients for <code>rsh</code>,<code>rcp</code>, and <code>rlogin</code>.</td>

</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default,
functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives. These
unnecessary capabilities are often overlooked and therefore may remain
unsecure. They increase the risk to the platform by providing additional
attack vectors.

The telnet service provides an unencrypted remote access service which does
not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the

although TCP and RELP provide more reliable message delivery,
they may not be supported in all environments.

systems. This data can be used as an additional log source in the event a
system is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log messages

to forward its logs to a particular log server by
adding or correcting one of the following lines,
substituting <code><i><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"></xccdf-1.1:sub></i></code> appropriately.
The choice of protocol depends on the environment of the system;
although TCP and RELP provide more reliable message delivery,
they may not be supported in all environments.
<br>
To use UDP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* @<i><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"></xccdf-1.1:sub></i></pre>
<br>
To use TCP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* @@<i><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"></xccdf-1.1:sub></i></pre>
<br>
To use RELP for log message delivery:
<pre>*.* :omrelp:<i><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"></xccdf-1.1:sub></i></pre>
<br>
There must be a resolvable DNS CNAME or Alias record set to "<xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="rsyslog_remote_loghost_address"></xccdf-1.1:sub>" for logs to be sent correctly to the centralized logging utility.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">A log server (loghost) receives syslog messages from one or more
systems. This data can be used as an additional log source in the event a
system is compromised and its local logs are suspect. Forwarding log messages
to a remote loghost also provides system administrators with a centralized
place to view the status of multiple hosts within the enterprise.</td>
