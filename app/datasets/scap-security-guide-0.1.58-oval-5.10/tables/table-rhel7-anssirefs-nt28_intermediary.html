<td>Set Password Maximum Age</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">To specify password maximum age for new accounts,
edit the file <code>/etc/login.defs</code>
and add or correct the following line:
<pre>PASS_MAX_DAYS <xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></pre>
A value of 180 days is sufficient for many environments.
The DoD requirement is 60.
The profile requirement is <code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_maximum_age_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore, passwords
need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does not limit the lifetime
of passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the
operating system passwords could be compromised.
<br><br>
Setting the password maximum age ensures users are required to
periodically change their passwords. Requiring shorter password lifetimes
increases the risk of users writing down the password in a convenient
location subject to physical compromise.</td>

<td>Set Password Minimum Length in login.defs</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">To specify password length requirements for new accounts, edit the file

<code><xccdf-1.1:sub xmlns:xccdf-1.1="http://checklists.nist.gov/xccdf/1.1" idref="var_accounts_password_minlen_login_defs"></xccdf-1.1:sub></code>.
If a program consults <code>/etc/login.defs</code> and also another PAM module
(such as <code>pam_pwquality</code>) during a password change operation, then
the most restrictive must be satisfied. See PAM section for more
information about enforcing password quality requirements.</td>
<td xml:lang="en-US">Requiring a minimum password length makes password
cracking attacks more difficult by ensuring a larger
search space. However, any security benefit from an onerous requirement
must be carefully weighed against usability problems, support costs, or counterproductive
behavior that may result.</td>

the effectiveness of a password in resisting attempts at guessing and brute-force

Password complexity is one factor of several that determines how long it takes
to crack a password. The more complex the password, the greater the number of

only the owner of a given file may remove that file from the
directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky
bit prevents users from removing each other's files. In cases where
there is no reason for a directory to be world-writable, a better
solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application,
consult that application's documentation instead of blindly
changing modes.
